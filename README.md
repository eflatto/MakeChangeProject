# MakeChangeProject

# Description

This Java program calculates the change due when the user inputs the price of an item and the amount tendered. The program calculates the change due and then breaks it down into the number of bills and coins of each denomination, using the least amount of coins and bills possible. This program can only return up to 20 dollar bills.

The program uses the Scanner class to take input from the user. The main method calculates the change due, and then calls the printChange method to break the change down into the number of bills and coins of each denomination. 

# Technologies Used

This project was implemented using Java as a programming language and Eclipse as an IDE.

# Lessons Learned

1. The importance of breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.

2. The significance of considering edge cases and how they can affect the overall program.

3. The importance of understanding the different data types and the implications of casting between them.
